Biogeography is concerned with the study of mechanisms shaping the geographic
repartition of species. Although the list of mechanisms is clearly identified,
biogeographers still search for a consistent theory to structure their interplay.
Among the challenge frequently pinpointed is the integration of ecological interactions in
species distribution models. On the one hand, the literature points out evidences
underlining the controlling role of interaction on local communities structure.
On the other hand, relatively few studies unravel imprints of interaction in
species distribution data. Developing a clear explanation for this apparent
vanishing remains a major challenge biogeography needs to take up.
The main issue regarding the lack of a clear answer regarding the role of
interactions at broad spatial scales is that most of scenarios of biodiversity
changes assume that interactions can be neglected. If this hypothesis is often
proved false, then the scenarios must be reviewed and sustain the development
of methodologies including relationship among species.


The thesis herein presented is a brainwork on the role of interaction on species
distribution. I start with a theoretical investigation on the topic as classical
theories push ecological interactions into the background. Hence, in chapter
\ref{chap1}, I present the integration of interaction into a a theoretical model
of species distribution coming from one of the most important theory in biogeography:
the theory of island biogeography. This work shows how the joint effect of biotic
and abiotic factors affect the expectations derived from the classical theory.
Based on this first chapter, in chapter \ref{chap2}, I show how interaction can
affect co-occurrence data. Such data contains the presence or absence of several
species for a similar set of sites dispersed along a large geographic gradient.
Using a probabilistic model, I obtain theoretical results linking co-occurrence
data and the information included in ecological networks. I clearly demonstrate
that interactions shape co-occurrence data. I further show that the higher
the number of links between two species the harder the detection of interactions.
Similarly if a species experience many interactions, it is then challenging to
detect any sign of interactions in co-occurrence data.

In chapter\ref{chap3}, I print the analysis of five datasets of co-occurrence
for which the description of interactions was available. This analysis confirms
the hypotheses made in chapter \ref{chap2}. I show that interacting species
co-occur differently from non-interacting one. My results also point out the
abundance of interaction must preclude their detection in co-occurrence data.
However, when accounting for abiotic similarities among sites, signals of
interactions are weakened. Therefore, my results suggest that using abiotic
factors to infer co-occurrence probabilities, a part of the links between species
is captured, but this part remains uncertain. This questions the quality of
the prediction classical species distribution models make.

My findings bring new theoretical element on the contribution of ecological
interactions on the shape of species geographical repartition and also introduce
a original method to study the species co-occurrence : examining them in the
light of ecological networks. Before concluding, I propose in chapter \ref{chap4}
a promising avenue to go further in the integration of interaction in
biogeography: introducing them through energetic constraints. This last chapter
presents the hope I base for a metabolic theory of biogeography.
