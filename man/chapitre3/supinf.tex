\subsection{Traits-based distance}\label{traits-based-distance}

Kind of data / methofd of clutering (sf table E)

For trees, we used a trait-based distance built of nine functional
traits whose values retrieved form ({\textbf{???}}), see
\textbf{Supplementary Table 3}.

\subsection{Building metaweb}\label{building-metaweb}

For datasets 1,2,3 we built network based on observed interactions and
derived associated quantities, \emph{i.e.} degrees of species and
shortest-path, using the R package ``igraph'' (see Supplementary table
2).

\subsection{Co-occurrence measurement}\label{co-occurrence-measurement}

Following ({\textbf{???}}), for a given pair of species \(i\) and \(j\),
we examined the relationship between the observed co-occurrence
\(O_{i,j}\) and the expected co-occurrence \(E_{i,j}\) in light of their
relative position of species within the network. The expected
co-occurrence is derived based on the assumption that species are
independent.

\subsection{Hypergeometric
distribution}\label{hypergeometric-distribution}

This distribution has been mentioned in a different context (see
{\textbf{???}}) but have been fully exploited only in ({\textbf{???}})
despite the author never mentioned it is a classical distribution. To
clarify this, we start from the distribution written in equation (1) in
Veech (2013). We consider \(n\) sites in which two species 1 and 2 may
occur. Species 1 is present in\$ \(n_1\) while 2 is present in \(n_2\)
sites. The probability of having \(j\) co\_occurrence, \(p_j\) is :

\[ p_j= \frac{\binom{n}{j} \binom{n-j}{n_2-j} \binom{n-n_2}{n_1-j}}{\binom{n}{n_2} \binom{n}{n_2}} \]

if \(\max{0, n_1+n_2-n} \leq j \leq \min{n_1, n_2}\) and 0 otherwise.
The expression above yields:

\[ p_j= \frac{n!}{(n-j)!j!} \frac{(n-j)!}{(n-j-n_2+j)!(n_2-j)!} \frac{(n-n_2)!}{(n-n_2-n_1+j)!(n_1-j)!} \frac{(n-n_1)!n_1!}{n!} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{n_2}} \]

by rearrangemnt :

\[ p_j= \frac{1}{j!} \frac{1}{(n_2-j)!} \frac{1}{(n-n_2-n_1+j)!(n_1-j)!} \frac{(n-n_1)!n_1!}{1} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{n_2}} \]

once sorted out, thi results in :

\[ p_j= \frac{\binom{n_1}{j} \binom{n-n_1}{n_2-j}}{\binom{n}{n_2}} \]

Thus, the number of co-occurrence follows a hypergeometric distribution
of parameters \((n,n_1,n_2)\) we used to calculated the expected
co-occurrence \(E_{i,j}\) under the hypothesis that all site were
identical for all species.

\subsection{GLM and RF}\label{glm-and-rf}

\subsubsection{Climatic data}\label{climatic-data}

We used the global climate layers provided data WolrdClim, version 1.4,
available at \url{http://www.worldclim.org} ({\textbf{???}}). For each
dataset, we performed a principal component analysis and keep as many
axes as needed to explain 90\% of the total inertia. We used these axis
in GLM and RF.

\subsubsection{Generalized Linear Model}\label{generalized-linear-model}

For all datasets, we performed a Generalized Linear Model
({\textbf{???}}) using all the axis provided by the PCA as polynomials
of degree 2. To constraints the number of parameters, we did not
evaluate the interactions among axis. We also performed a selection
model based on the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) C in a Stepwise
Algorithm. R functions used to carry out the analyses are indexed in
table SX.

\subsubsection{Random Forests}\label{random-forests}

Random Forests ({\textbf{???}}) were performed using the same formula as
for GLMs. For all species 10000 trees were computed and the probability
for a species being in a given site were calculated based on the number
of votes the sites were granted.

\subsection{Mean Z-score log
occupancy}\label{mean-z-score-log-occupancy}

Distribution of Z-score =\textgreater{} normal \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\)

For all species we add occupancy meaning that degree plus total spaced
occupied are integrated,

\subsection{Model Evaluation}\label{model-evaluation}

For all species, we assess the performance of the Species Distribution
Models we used, \emph{i.e.} Generalized Linear Model and Random Forest,
using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
({\textbf{???}}). We present the results as a cumulative sum of
frequencies corresponding to the score for all species for each of the
four ecological systems we studied (see Figure= ({\textbf{???}})).

\subsection{Trees}\label{trees}

Based on table ({\textbf{???}}) we scale all the variable and used then
to generate a synthetic distance variables are unweighted leading to a
dendrograms present in figure \ref{fig:dendro}.
