  abstract	= {Species Temporal Turnover (STT) is one of the most
		  familiar metrics to assess changes in assemblage
		  composition as a consequence of climate change. However,
		  STT mixes two components in one metric, changes in
		  assemblage composition caused by a process of species loss
		  or gain (i.e. the nestedness component) and changes in
		  assemblage composition caused by a process of species
		  replacement (i.e. the species replacement component).
		  Drawing on previous studies investigating spatial patterns
		  of beta diversity, we propose measures of STT that allow
		  analysing each component (species replacement vs.
		  nestedness), separately. We also present a mapping strategy
		  to simultaneously visualize changes in species richness and
		  assemblage composition. To illustrate our approach, we used
		  the Mediterranean coastal fish fauna as a case study. Using
		  Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) we first projected the
		  potential future climatic niches of 288 coastal
		  Mediterranean fish species based on a global warming
		  scenario. We then aggregated geographically the
		  species-level projections to analyse the projected changes
		  in species richness and composition. Our results show that
		  projected changes in assemblage composition are caused by
		  different processes (species replacement vs. nestedness) in
		  several areas of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, our
		  mapping strategy highlights that the coastal fish fauna in
		  several regions of the Mediterranean Sea could experience a
		  cul-de-sac effect if exposed to climate warming. Overall,
		  the joint exploration of changes in species richness and
		  composition coupled with the distinction between species
		  replacement and nestedness bears important information for
		  understanding the nature of climate change impacts on
		  biodiversity. These methodological advances should help
		  decision-makers in prioritizing action in the areas facing
		  the greatest vulnerability to climate.},

		  interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of
		  species have well-defined interactions (for example
		  predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend
		  May's results to these relationships and find remarkable
		  differences between predator-prey interactions, which are

		  structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance
		  of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively
		  affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks.
		  These results are found by separating the contribution of
		  network structure and interaction strengths to stability.
		  Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and

		  checkerboard patterns of co-occurrence that are discernible
		  at finer resolutions but that are lost and increasing
		  scales of resolution. Scale dependence in
		  consumer–resource interactions (+/-) depends on the
		  strength of positive dependencies between species. If the

		  effect, then interactions scale up similarly to positive

		  understanding the maintenance of diversity and the
		  potential effects of species losses and gains on

		  assessing species richness in a food web context can
		  provide further insight into the relationship between

		  mechanisms underpinning this relationship. Here, we
		  assessed how species richness and trophic diversity affect
		  decomposition rates in a complete aquatic food web: the
		  five trophic level web that occurs within water-filled
		  leaves of the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea.
		  We identified a trophic cascade in which

		  mosquito--indirectly increased bacterial decomposition by
		  preying on bactivorous protozoa. Our data also revealed a
		  facultative relationship in which larvae of the
		  pitcher-plant midge increased bacterial decomposition by
		  shredding detritus. These important interactions occur only
		  in food webs with high trophic diversity, which in turn
		  only occur in food webs with high species richness. We show
		  that species richness and trophic diversity underlie strong
		  linkages between food web structure and dynamics that

  abstract	= {Food webs, networks of feeding relationships in an
		  ecosystem, provide fundamental insights into mechanisms
		  that determine ecosystem stability and persistence. A
		  standard approach in food-web analysis, and network
		  analysis in general, has been to identify compartments, or
		  modules, defined by many links within compartments and few
		  links between them. This approach can identify large
		  habitat boundaries in the network but may fail to identify
		  other important structures. Empirical analyses of food webs
		  have been further limited by low-resolution data for
		  primary producers. In this paper, we present a Bayesian
		  computational method for identifying group structure using
		  a flexible definition that can describe both functional
		  trophic roles and standard compartments. We apply this
		  method to a newly compiled plant-mammal food web from the
		  Serengeti ecosystem that includes high taxonomic resolution
		  at the plant level, allowing a simultaneous examination of
		  the signature of both habitat and trophic roles in network
		  structure. We find that groups at the plant level reflect
		  habitat structure, coupled at higher trophic levels by
		  groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by
		  carnivore groups. Thus the group structure of the Serengeti
		  web represents a mixture of trophic guild structure and
		  spatial pattern, in contrast to the standard compartments
		  typically identified. The network topology supports recent
		  ideas on spatial coupling and energy channels in ecosystems
		  that have been proposed as important for persistence.
		  Furthermore, our Bayesian approach provides a powerful,
		  flexible framework for the study of network structure, and
		  we believe it will prove instrumental in a variety of

		  to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing
		  due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in
		  GBIF. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality
		  would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality
		  evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the

		  models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure
		  removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not
		  of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less
		  spatial bias produce better predictive models even though
		  they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine
		  may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of

		  warn of automatized applications of species distribution

		  of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this
		  review, we first examine the different possible effects of
		  climate change that can operate at individual, population,
		  species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably
		  showing that species can respond to climate change
		  challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three
		  non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g.
		  range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the
		  principal specificities and caveats of the most common
		  approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global
		  and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results.
		  Finally, we highlight several challenges for future
		  research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall,
		  our review shows that current estimates are very variable,
		  depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss
		  metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet,
		  the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for
		  biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to
		  extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass
		  extinction in the history of the earth.},

  abstract	= {Aim Although it is recognized that ecological patterns are
		  scale dependent, the exact scales over which specific
		  ecological processes operate are still a matter of
		  controversy. In particular, understanding the scales over
		  which biotic interactions operate is critical for
		  predicting changes in species distributions in the face of
		  the ongoing biodiversity crisis. It has been hypothesized
		  that biotic interactions operate predominately at fine
		  grains, yet this conjecture has received relatively little
		  empirical scrutiny. We use US woodpeckers as a model system
		  to assess the relative importance of biotic interactions,
		  environmental suitability and geographic proximity to other
		  intraspecific occurrence sites, across scales. Location
		  Conterminous United States. Methods We combined species
		  occurrence data from the North American Breeding Bird
		  Survey (BBS) with a large pair-wise interaction matrix
		  describing known interactions among woodpeckers and other
		  bird species. Using a logistic mixed modelling framework we
		  then established the relative importance of biotic
		  interactions as predictors of woodpecker occurrences in
		  relation to environment and geographic proximity to
		  intraspecific occurrence sites. Results We found that
		  geographic proximity becomes a stronger predictor of
		  woodpecker occurrence as grain becomes coarser, while
		  environment is grain-invariant. As opposed to environment
		  and geographic proximity, we found that when the focal
		  species experienced positive biotic interactions, the
		  importance of interactions decreased with increased grain.
		  However, positive interactions remained important up to a
		  grain size of entire BBS routes (c. 40 km), which is much
		  coarser than the grain size used by most species
		  distribution models. In contrast, when the focal species
		  experienced negative interactions we did not find clear
		  grain dependence. Main conclusions Biotic interactions
		  (both positive and negative) are important predictors of
		  species occurrences. While these interactions are strongest
		  at fine grains, they can remain important even at coarse
		  grains, and are thus critical for predicting distributional
		  changes in the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis.},

		  biologists for decades. While some have explored how
		  stability may be achieved in small modules of a few
		  interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large
		  complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically

		  help fill this void by combining structural models of

		  reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators
		  when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey
		  respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical
		  predator-prey body mass ratios from a global data base.
		  Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species
		  richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become
		  neutral or positive relationships at these empirical
		  ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator-prey

		  composition of the aquatic food web found in the
		  liquid-filled leaves of the North American purple pitcher
		  plant, Sarracenia purpurea (Sarraceniaceae), from local to
		  continental scales. Location We sampled 20 pitcher-plant
		  communities at each of 39 sites spanning the geographic
		  range of S. purpurea– from northern Florida to
		  Newfoundland and westward to eastern British Columbia.
		  Methods Environmental predictors of variation in species
		  composition and species richness were measured at two
		  different spatial scales: among pitchers within sites and
		  among sites. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to
		  examine correlates and similarities of species richness and
		  abundance within and among sites. Results Ninety-two taxa
		  of arthropods, protozoa and bacteria were identified in the
		  780 pitcher samples. The variation in the species
		  composition of this multi-trophic level community across
		  the broad geographic range of the host plant was lower than
		  the variation among pitchers within host-plant populations.
		  Variation among food webs in richness and composition was
		  related to climate, pore-water chemistry, pitcher-plant
		  morphology and leaf age. Variation in the abundance of the
		  five most common invertebrates was also strongly related to
		  pitcher morphology and site-specific climatic and other
		  environmental variables. Main conclusions The surprising
		  result that these communities are more variable within
		  their host-plant populations than across North America
		  suggests that the food web in S. purpurea leaves consists
		  of two groups of species: (1) a core group of mostly
		  obligate pitcher-plant residents that have evolved strong
		  requirements for the host plant and that co-occur
		  consistently across North America, and (2) a larger set of
		  relatively uncommon, generalist taxa that co-occur
		  patchily. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Global

		  factors? Here, we systematically review the proximate
		  causes of climate-change related extinctions and their
		  empirical support. We find 136 case studies of climatic
		  impacts that are potentially relevant to this topic.
		  However, only seven identified proximate causes of

		  cause, especially decreases in food availability. We find
		  very similar patterns in studies showing decreases in
		  abundance associated with climate change, and in those
		  studies showing impacts of climatic oscillations.
		  Collectively, these results highlight our disturbingly

  abstract	= {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in
		  community ecology since the foundation of the discipline.
		  Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of
		  information to model species distributions and
		  biogeographers are still debating about the impact of
		  biotic interactions on species distributions across
		  geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species
		  co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better
		  inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate
		  hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and
		  to extend the analysis of species distributions currently
		  focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic
		  factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the
		  first building blocks of a general theory for species
		  co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions
		  of the different probabilities that are studied in the
		  context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species
		  interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations
		  in order to document five principles influencing the
		  associations between species within an ecological network:
		  (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii)
		  indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii)
		  pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the
		  strength of an association decreases with the length of the
		  shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of
		  an association decreases with the number of interactions a
		  species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty
		  of the interpretation of species interactions from
		  co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the
		  structure of interaction networks is feasible from
		  co-occurrence data. We also argue that species
		  distributions models could benefit from incorporating
		  conditional probabilities of interactions within the models
		  as an attempt to take into account the contribution of
		  biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of
		  species.},

  abstract	= {The net effects of interspecific species interactions on
		  individuals and populations vary in both sign (-, 0, +) and
		  magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are
		  context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as
		  a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context
		  dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature
		  is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to
		  quantify variation in species interaction outcomes
		  (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published
		  articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the
		  magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species
		  interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change
		  sign across contexts (and predation least likely),
		  mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both
		  the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the
		  most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a
		  function of the presence/absence of a third species.
		  However, the degree of context dependency across these
		  context types was not consistent among mutualism,
		  competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study
		  location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context
		  dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest
		  variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context
		  dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean
		  outcomes, can provide a general method for describing
		  patterns of variation in nature.},

@Article{	  clark2014,
  abstract	= {The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated
		  from species distribution models that are fitted to many
		  species independently and then added together. This
		  approach ignores the fact that species are jointly
		  distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the
		  same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of
		  any one species can be constrained by competition; a large
		  increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others.
		  Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses
		  modeled independently do not agree with the species
		  richness or basal areas of actual forests. We introduce a
		  joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which
		  is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern
		  North America. First, it accommodates the joint
		  distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution
		  includes both abundance and presence-absence data. We solve
		  the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance
		  data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal
		  area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally,
		  inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution
		  of predictions to integrate the role of climate risks
		  across all species and identify geographic areas where
		  communities will change most (in terms of changes in
		  abundance) with climate change. Application to forests in
		  the eastern United States shows that climate can have
		  greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and
		  in the Upper Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation.
		  Thus, these are the regions experiencing the fastest
		  warming and are also identified as most responsive at this
		  scale.},

  abstract	= {Broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness is strongly
		  correlated with climate. Many mechanisms have been
		  hypothesized to explain these patterns; however, testable
		  predictions that would distinguish among them have rarely
		  been derived. Here, we examine several prominent hypotheses
		  for climate–richness relationships, deriving and testing
		  predictions based on their hypothesized mechanisms. The
		  ?energy–richness hypothesis? (also called the ?more
		  individuals hypothesis? ) postulates that more productive
		  areas have more individuals and therefore more species.
		  More productive areas do often have more species, but
		  extant data are not consistent with the expected causal
		  relationship from energy to numbers of individuals to
		  numbers of species. We reject the energy–richness
		  hypothesis in its standard form and consider some proposed
		  modifications. The ?physiological tolerance hypothesis?
		  postulates that richness varies according to the tolerances
		  of individual species for different sets of climatic
		  conditions. This hypothesis predicts that more combinations
		  of physiological parameters can survive under warm and wet
		  than cold or dry conditions. Data are qualitatively
		  consistent with this prediction, but are inconsistent with
		  the prediction that species should fill climatically
		  suitable areas. Finally, the ?speciation rate hypothesis?
		  postulates that speciation rates should vary with climate,
		  due either to faster evolutionary rates or stronger biotic
		  interactions increasing the opportunity for evolutionary
		  diversification in some regions. The biotic interactions
		  mechanism also has the potential to amplify shallower,
		  underlying gradients in richness. Tests of speciation rate
		  hypotheses are few (to date), and their results are
		  mixed.},

  abstract	= {Across a wide array of animal species, mean population

		  of energy use of local populations is approximately
		  independent of body size. This "energetic equivalence" is
		  particularly evident when ecological population densities
		  are plotted across several or more orders of magnitude in
		  body mass and is supported by a considerable body of
		  evidence. Nevertheless, interpretation of the data has
		  remained controversial, largely because of the difficulty
		  of explaining the origin and maintenance of such a
		  size-abundance relationship in terms of purely ecological
		  processes. Here I describe results of a simulation model
		  suggesting that an extremely simple mechanism operating
		  over evolutionary time can explain the major features of
		  the empirical data. The model specifies only the size
		  scaling of metabolism and a process where randomly chosen
		  species evolve to take resource energy from other species.
		  This process of energy exchange among particular species is
		  distinct from a random walk of species abundances and
		  creates a situation in which species populations using
		  relatively low amounts of energy at any body size have an
		  elevated extinction risk. Selective extinction of such
		  species rapidly drives size-abundance allometry in faunas
		  toward approximate energetic equivalence and maintains it

  abstract	= {Many attempts to predict the biotic responses to climate
		  change rely on the 'climate envelope' approach, in which
		  the current distribution of a species is mapped in

		  is that distributions of species also reflect the influence

		  An additional problem is that current distributions may be
		  the result of sources and sinks, in which species appear to
		  thrive in places where they really persist only because
		  individuals disperse into them from elsewhere. Here we use
		  microcosm experiments on simple but realistic assemblages

		  survey data. The log-transformation of the power model is a
		  straight line; therefore, if one knows the average number

		  true species number present in the land class, using
		  EstimateS software, it is possible to calculate the slope

		  proportion of area required to represent a given proportion
		  of species present in any land class. This application of
		  the SAR is explored using phytosociological releve data
		  from South Africa's Succulent Karoo biome. We also provide
		  suggestions for extrapolating the estimated z-values to
		  other land classes within a bioregion that lack sufficient
		  survey data, using the relationship between z-values and
		  remotely determined landscape variables such as habitat
		  diversity (topographic diversity) and geographic location
		  (latitude and longitude). The SAR predicts that for most
		  Succulent Karoo vegetation types a conservation target of
		  10{\%} of the land area would not be sufficient to conserve
		  the majority of species. We also demonstrate that not all
		  land classes are equal from a plant biodiversity
		  perspective, so applying one target to all land classes in
		  a region will lead to significant gaps and inefficiencies
		  in any reserve network based on this universal target.},

  abstract	= {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools
		  that combine observations of species occurrence or
		  abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to
		  gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict
		  distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring
		  extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used
		  across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms.
		  Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both
		  differences in species mobility and in “established
		  use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by
		  selection of relevant predictors and modeling method,
		  consideration of scale, how the interplay between
		  environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the
		  extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM
		  practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering
		  progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of
		  methods for modeling presence-only data and for model
		  selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic
		  interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

		  gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest

		  availability is a direct determinant of both local- and

  abstract	= {Correlations between the amount of energy received by an
		  assemblage and the number of species that it contains are
		  very general, and at the macro-scale such species-energy
		  relationships typically follow a monotonically increasing
		  curve. Whilst the ecological literature contains frequent
		  reports of such relationships, debate on their causal
		  mechanisms is limited and typically focuses on the role of
		  energy availability in controlling the number of
		  individuals in an assemblage. Assemblages from high-energy
		  areas may contain more individuals enabling species to
		  maintain larger, more viable populations, whose lower
		  extinction risk elevates species richness. Other mechanisms
		  have, however, also been suggested. Here we identify and
		  clarify nine principal mechanisms that may generate
		  positive species-energy relationships at the macro-scale.
		  We critically assess their assumptions and applicability
		  over a range of spatial scales, derive predictions for each
		  and assess the evidence that supports or refutes them. Our
		  synthesis demonstrates that all mechanisms share at least
		  one of their predictions with an alternative mechanism.
		  Some previous studies of species-energy relationships
		  appear not to have recognised the extent of shared
		  predictions, and this may detract from their contribution
		  to the debate on causal mechanisms. The combination of
		  predictions and assumptions made by each mechanism is,
		  however, unique, suggesting that, in principle, conclusive
		  tests are possible. Sufficient testing of all mechanisms
		  has yet to be conducted, and no single mechanism currently
		  has unequivocal support. Each may contribute to
		  species-energy relationships in some circumstances, but
		  some mechanisms are unlikely to act simultaneously.
		  Moreover, a limited number appear particularly likely to
		  contribute frequently to species-energy relationships at
		  the macro-scale. The increased population size, niche
		  position and diversification rate mechanisms are
		  particularly noteworthy in this context.},

  abstract	= {Primates, the mammalian order including our own species,
		  comprise 480 species in 78 genera. Thus, they represent the
		  third largest of the 18 orders of eutherian mammals.
		  Although recent phylogenetic studies on primates are
		  increasingly built on molecular datasets, most of these
		  studies have focused on taxonomic subgroups within the
		  order. Complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes have proven to
		  be extremely useful in deciphering within-order
		  relationships even up to deep nodes. Using 454 sequencing,
		  we sequenced 32 new complete mt genomes adding 20
		  previously not represented genera to the phylogenetic
		  reconstruction of the primate tree. With 13 new sequences,
		  the number of complete mt genomes within the parvorder
		  Platyrrhini was widely extended, resulting in a largely
		  resolved branching pattern among New World monkey families.
		  We added 10 new Strepsirrhini mt genomes to the 15
		  previously available ones, thus almost doubling the number
		  of mt genomes within this clade. Our data allow precise
		  date estimates of all nodes and offer new insights into
		  primate evolution. One major result is a relatively young
		  date for the most recent common ancestor of all living
		  primates which was estimated to 66-69 million years ago,
		  suggesting that the divergence of extant primates started
		  close to the K/T-boundary. Although some relationships
		  remain unclear, the large number of mt genomes used allowed
		  us to reconstruct a robust primate phylogeny which is
		  largely in agreement with previous publications. Finally,

		  knowledge of a large number of environments that do not

		  niche. I then demonstrate that such an analysis has a
		  natural interpretation as an estimate of the probability
		  that an environment is suitable and that either
		  experimental investigations or analyses of presence data
		  can estimate this quantity. Depending on the way that
		  resources interact to shape environmental requirements, the
		  probability that an environment is a part of the niche
		  behaves like published descriptions of causal inferences

		  Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this

		  in structuring biotic communities at fine spatial scales is
		  well documented, but the signature of species interactions
		  at coarser spatial scales is unclear. We present evidence
		  that species interactions may be a significant factor in
		  mediating the regional assembly of the Danish avifauna.
		  Because {\textgreater}95{\%} of breeding species ( = 197)
		  are migratory, we hypothesized that dispersal limitation
		  would not be important and that breeding distributions
		  would largely reflect resource availability and
		  autecological habitat preferences. Instead, we detected a
		  striking pattern of spatial segregation between
		  ecologically similar species at two spatial scales with a
		  suite of null models that factored in the spatial
		  distribution of habitats in Denmark as well as population
		  size and biomass of each species. Habitat utilization
		  analyses indicated that community-wide patterns of spatial
		  segregation could not be attributed to the patchy
		  distribution of habitat or to gross differences in habitat
		  utilization among ecologically similar species. We
		  hypothesize that, when habitat patch size is limited,
		  conspecific attraction in concert with interspecific
		  territoriality may result in spatially segregated
		  distributions of ecologically similar species at larger
		  spatial scales. In the Danish avifauna, the effects of
		  species interactions on community assembly appear pervasive
		  and can be discerned at grain sizes up to four orders of
		  magnitude larger than those of individual territories.
		  These results suggest that species interactions should be
		  incorporated into species distribution modeling algorithms
		  designed to predict species occupancy patterns based on
		  environmental variables},

		  neutral processes. From this model, we predict and test
		  whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral
		  processes in controlling community dynamics will vary
		  depending on community species richness, niche overlap and
		  dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long
		  distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality
		  form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic
		  exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive
		  exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches.
		  However, immigration prevents the establishment of a
		  limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of
		  a set of complementary and redundant species, with their
		  abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of

		  Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are

		  conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by

		  ranges, and indirectly, for example through changes in
		  human land use that may result in habitat loss. Shifting
		  patterns of agricultural production in response to climate
		  change have received little attention as a potential impact
		  pathway for ecosystems. Wine grape production provides a
		  good test case for measuring indirect impacts mediated by
		  changes in agriculture, because viticulture is sensitive to
		  climate and is concentrated in Mediterranean climate
		  regions that are global biodiversity hotspots. Here we
		  demonstrate that, on a global scale, the impacts of climate
		  change on viticultural suitability are substantial, leading
		  to possible conservation conflicts in land use and
		  freshwater ecosystems. Area suitable for viticulture
		  decreases 25{\%} to 73{\%} in major wine producing regions
		  by 2050 in the higher RCP 8.5 concentration pathway and
		  19{\%} to 62{\%} in the lower RCP 4.5. Climate change may
		  cause establishment of vineyards at higher elevations that
		  will increase impacts on upland ecosystems and may lead to
		  conversion of natural vegetation as production shifts to
		  higher latitudes in areas such as western North America.
		  Attempts to maintain wine grape productivity and quality in
		  the face of warming may be associated with increased water
		  use for irrigation and to cool grapes through misting or

  abstract	= {Extinction from habitat loss is the signature conservation
		  problem of the twenty-first century. Despite its
		  importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly
		  uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data
		  exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used
		  indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by
		  reversing the species-area accumulation curve,
		  extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate
		  expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based
		  on this method are almost always much higher than those
		  actually observed. This discrepancy gave rise to the
		  concept of an 'extinction debt', referring to species
		  'committed to extinction' owing to habitat loss and reduced
		  population size but not yet extinct during a
		  non-equilibrium period. Here we show that the extinction
		  debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact
		  due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying
		  sampling problems when constructing a species-area
		  relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species
		  extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result
		  is that the area required to remove the last individual of
		  a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much
		  larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first
		  individual of a species, irrespective of species
		  distribution and spatial scale. We illustrate these results
		  with data from a global network of large, mapped forest
		  plots and ranges of passerine bird species in the
		  continental USA; and we show that overestimation can be
		  greater than 160{\%}. Although we conclude that extinctions
		  caused by habitat loss require greater loss of habitat than
		  previously thought, our results must not lead to
		  complacency about extinction due to habitat loss, which is
		  a real and growing threat.},

  abstract	= {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land
		  areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30
		  arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The
		  climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and
		  mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were
		  gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible,
		  were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We
		  used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented
		  in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude,
		  longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We
		  quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the
		  interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation
		  bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation
		  within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross
		  validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations
		  lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the
		  tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in
		  poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high
		  uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in
		  the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to
		  10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within
		  grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution
		  surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc
		  min resolution showed overall agreement, but with
		  significant variation in some regions. A comparison with
		  two high-resolution data sets for the United States also
		  identified areas with large local differences, particularly
		  in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global
		  climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data
		  are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or
		  more); more weather station records were used; improved
		  elevation data were used; and more information about
		  spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available.
		  Owing to the overall low density of available climate
		  stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that
		  may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of
		  precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such
		  variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods
		  and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly
		  layers obtained through remote sensing. Copyright

  abstract	= {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed
		  that one could characterize the ecological niche of a
		  species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto
		  an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and
		  biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a
		  habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a
		  population should persist without immigration from external
		  sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it
		  faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential
		  to understanding controls on species' geographical range
		  limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly
		  changing world. Recent developments in ecology and
		  evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and
		  refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing
		  techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties
		  that arise because of impacts species have on their own
		  environments, the density-dependent modulation of how
		  individuals experience environments, and the interplay of
		  dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining
		  population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record
		  over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change
		  in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound
		  niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around
		  the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche
		  include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific
		  and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the
		  factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential
		  evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body
		  of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for
		  understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the
		  way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

		  {\textgreater}100 coexisting species for the marine rocky
		  intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our

		  highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to
		  food web structure. The occurrence of different types of
		  interactions, relative to all possible links, was well
		  predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the
		  source and target species. In this community, competition
		  for space and positive interactions related to
		  habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species

@Article{	  macarthur1963,
  abstract	= {A graphical equilibrium model, balancing immigration and
		  extinction rates of species, has been developed which
		  appears fully consistent with the fauna-area curves and the
		  distance effect seen in land and freshwater bird faunas of
		  the Indo-Australian islands. The establishment of the
		  equilibrium condition allows the development of a more
		  precise zoogeographic theory than hitherto possible. One
		  new and non-obvious prediction can be made from the model
		  which is immediately verifiable from existing data, that
		  the number of species increases with area more rapidly on
		  far islands than on near ones. Similarly, the number of
		  species on large islands decreases with distance faster
		  than does the number of species on small islands. As groups
		  of islands pass from the unsaturated to saturated
		  conditions, the variance-to-mean ratio should change from
		  unity to about one-half. When the faunal buildup reaches
		  90{\%} of the equilibrium number, the extinction rate in
		  species/year should equal 2.303 times the variance divided
		  by the time (in years) required to reach the 90{\%} level.
		  The implications of this relation are discussed with
		  reference to the Krakatau faunas, where the buildup rate is
		  known. A 'radiation zone,' in which the rate of
		  intra-archipelagic exchange of autochthonous species
		  approaches or exceeds extraarchipelagic immigration toward
		  the outer limits of the taxon's range, is predicted as
		  still another consequence of the equilibrium condition.
		  This condition seems to be fulfilled by conventional
		  information but cannot be rigorously tested with the
		  existing data. Where faunas are at or near equilibrium, it
		  should be possible to devise indirect estimates of the
		  actual immigration and extinction rates, as well as of the
		  times required to reach equilibrium. It should also be
		  possible to estimate the mean dispersal distance of
		  propagules overseas from the zoogeographic data.
		  Mathematical models have been constructed to these ends and
		  certain applications suggested. The main purpose of the
		  paper is to express the criteria and implications of the
		  equilibrium condition, without extending them for the
		  present beyond the IndoAustralian bird faunas.},

  abstract	= {Abstract Aim To investigate the association between
		  hummingbird–plant network structure and species richness,
		  phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern,
		  insularity and historical and current climate. Location
		  Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal
		  gradient across the Americas (39° N–32° S), ranging
		  from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland
		  and on islands and covering a wide range of climate
		  regimes. Methods We measured the level of specialization
		  and modularity in mutualistic plant–hummingbird
		  interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares
		  multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species
		  richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and
		  historical climate conditions on network structure
		  (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity).
		  Results Phylogenetically related species, especially
		  plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array
		  of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network
		  structure exhibited a constant association with species
		  phylogeny (R2 = 0.18–0.19); however, network structure
		  showed the strongest association with species richness and
		  environmental factors (R2 = 0.20–0.44 and R2 =
		  0.32–0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of
		  specialization and modularity were associated with
		  species-rich communities and communities in which closely
		  related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering
		  species. On the mainland, specialization was also
		  associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical
		  temperature stability. Main conclusions Our results confirm
		  the results of previous macroecological studies of
		  interaction networks which have highlighted the importance
		  of species richness and the environment in determining
		  network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we
		  report an association between network structure and species
		  phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating
		  that high specialization and modularity are associated with
		  high interspecific competition among closely related
		  hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a
		  tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds
		  and their plants than in previously studied plant–bird
		  mutualistic systems.},

  abstract	= {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and
		  processes occurring at the community level rather than at
		  the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial
		  aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests
		  that spatial processes influence both food web and

		  tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology,
		  which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape

		  materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this
		  conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand
		  ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate
		  the existence of interactions between the movements of
		  traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be
		  achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present
		  two models that highlight how this framework yields novel
		  insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and
		  spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem

		  nature and tend to involve species interactions and
		  speciation and extinction processes. In contrast, we
		  propose that several important macroecological patterns can
		  be explained by very large-scale processes that are
		  primarily spatial in nature. Specifically, we suggest that
		  the structure of abundance across a species' entire range
		  combined with interspecific patterns in range location and
		  global abundance can explain the well-known macroecological
		  patterns of: (1) a positive correlation between range size
		  and abundance, (2) the species-area relationship, (3) decay
		  of species similarity with distance and (4) the species
		  abundance distribution. We show that spatial processes
		  produce these patterns through a combination of analytical
		  and Monte Carlo analysis. We also show that the connection
		  is robust (indifferent) to the precise mathematical
		  assumptions. Such a theory might be called a unified
		  theory, because it explains multiple patterns with a few
		  processes. To differentiate among the growing number of
		  unified theories, we suggest that testing additional

@Article{	  mckinney2006,
  abstract	= {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one
		  of the most homogenizing of all major human activities.
		  Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are
		  built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one
		  species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries
		  in a disequilibrium state from the local natural
		  environment by the importation of vast resources of energy
		  and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the
		  planet, biological homogenization increases because the
		  same "urban-adaptable" species become increasingly
		  widespread and locally abundant in cities across the
		  planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of
		  disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of
		  homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely
		  modified built habitats at the urban core are "global
		  homogenizers", found in cities worldwide. However, many
		  suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native
		  species that become regionally widespread. These suburban
		  adapters typically consist of early successional plants and
		  "edge" animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and
		  ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can
		  utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats
		  available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is
		  that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant.
		  The intentional and unintentional importation of species
		  adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food
		  resources imported for human use, often produces local
		  species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or
		  greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important
		  exception of low-income areas, urban human populations
		  often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a
		  relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or
		  abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment
		  caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that,
		  because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to
		  city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become
		  increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and
		  their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should
		  therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration
		  of local indigenous species.},

  abstract	= {Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the
		  species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by
		  biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To
		  parameterize this realized niche, species distribution
		  models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to
		  abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic
		  predictors to help explain species distributions.
		  Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under
		  future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions
		  remain constant or exert only minor influence on
		  large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely
		  expected for species with high competitive ability. We
		  examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can
		  be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this
		  depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models
		  for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three
		  different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and
		  the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning
		  to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by
		  biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently.
		  Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs
		  substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic
		  predictors to explained deviance was relatively small (
		  9{\%}) compared to the contribution of each predictor set
		  individually ( 20{\%} each), indicating that the additional
		  information on the realized niche brought by adding other
		  species as predictors was largely independent of the
		  abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic
		  predictors was relatively high for species preferably
		  growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress,
		  species with long seed dispersal distances, species with
		  high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species
		  that occur frequently and are dominant across the
		  landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM
		  performance indicates that community composition and other

  abstract	= {1. To improve our understanding of the relationship
		  between the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) and the
		  phytotelma community inhabiting its leaves we built an
		  exploratory, mechanistic model based on stochiometric
		  constraints on carbon and nitrogen associated with prey
		  decomposition. 2. Our theoretical results suggest that the
		  phytotelma community is acting as a mineralizing system
		  producing nitrogen for the plant. This is confirmed by data
		  collected in the field and in the literature, that show the
		  amount of nitrogen produced by the decomposition of prey is
		  sufficiently high to be considered as a major source of
		  nitrogen for the plant. 3. In our model, nitrogen yield is
		  higher if the phytotelma community is restricted to
		  bacteria alone than when the full food web is present.
		  Nitrogen availability is negatively affected by
		  bacterivores (rotifers and protozoa mostly) and positively
		  affected by a cascading effect of mosquito larvae. 4. When
		  sedimentation rate is high, mosquitoes have a global
		  positive effect on nitrogen production because they
		  indirectly reduce the amount of nitrogen lost through
		  sedimentation more than they export nitrogen through
		  pupation. On the other hand, when sedimentation rate is low
		  there is a hump-shaped relationship between the uptake rate
		  of bacterivores by mosquito larvae and the nitrogen yield
		  in the plant. 5. We conclude that plant-bacteria and
		  plant-mosquito interactions are predominantly mutualistic,
		  whereas plant-bacterivore interactions are predominantly
		  parasitic. Our work also illustrates how ecosystem
		  properties (here nitrogen production by the phytotelma
		  community) can be understood as a function of trophic
		  complexity and can be seen as a product of selection at the

  abstract	= {Aim An important issue regarding biodiversity concerns its
		  influence on ecosystem functioning. Experimental work has
		  led to the proposal of mechanisms such as niche
		  complementarity. However, few attempts have been made to
		  confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests.
		  Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved
		  questions is whether the effects of complementarity on
		  ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of
		  competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity
		  gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we
		  asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity
		  positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of
		  diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What
		  metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic
		  diversity) better relates to tree productivity?Location
		  Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern
		  Canada.Methods Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from
		  temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our
		  hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used
		  to identify the best explanatory variables for tree
		  productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental
		  variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices,
		  were included in a structural equation model where links
		  (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit,
		  making structural equation modelling the best tool to
		  explore such complicated causal networks.Results This is
		  the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive
		  and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity
		  with control for climatic and environmental conditions.
		  Important differences were noted between the two forest
		  biomes investigated.Main conclusions We show for the first
		  time that complementarity may be less important in
		  temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive
		  environment where competitive exclusion is the most
		  probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the
		  more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial
		  interactions between species may be more important. The

  abstract	= {Abstract The task of modeling the distribution of a large
		  number of tree species under future climate scenarios
		  presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust
		  enough to handle climate data outside the current range
		  without producing unacceptable instability in the output.
		  In addition, the technique should have automatic search
		  mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values
		  for input model parameters for each species so that minimal
		  effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for
		  individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical
		  models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees
		  (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive
		  Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation
		  mapping under current and future climate scenarios
		  according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation
		  model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree
		  species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine
		  (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech
		  (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the
		  four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa
		  statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current
		  importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to
		  abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as
		  derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's
		  Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of
		  suitable habitat after climate change were visually more
		  reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance
		  by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation
		  estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values.
		  Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it
		  provided interpretive models for species whose
		  distributions were captured well by our current set of
		  predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current
		  distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We
		  consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially
		  when used together to take advantage of their individual
		  strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and

		  To address this, we used past and present primate

		  how a large extinction event within a taxon may alter
		  evolutionary relationships and phenotypic distributions

		  However, trait structures, including relative dispersion of

		  extinction. We posit that the overdispersed phylogenetic
		  patterns have resulted from the unique ecological and
		  evolutionary history of Madagascar's primates including a
		  rapid adaptive radiation in the presence of a broad
		  niche-space available during colonization. Differences in
		  trait structures between present and past primate

		  extinction in a large metapopulation(14) of the Glanville
		  fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia)(15). We found that
		  extinction risk increased significantly with decreasing
		  heterozygosity, an indication of inbreeding(6), even after
		  accounting for the effects of the relevant ecological
		  factors, Larval survival, adult longevity and egg-hatching
		  rate were found to be adversely affected by inbreeding and
		  appear to be the fitness components underlying the
		  relationship between inbreeding and extinction. To our
		  knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an effect of
		  inbreeding on the extinction of natural populations. Our
		  results are particularly relevant to the increasing number
		  of species with small local populations due to habitat loss
		  and fragmentation(16).},

  abstract	= {Intensified exploitation of natural populations and
		  habitats has led to increased mortality rates and decreased
		  abundances of many species. There is a growing concern that
		  this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species
		  to be crossed, with extinction cascades and state shifts in
		  ecosystems as a consequence. When increased mortality rate
		  and decreased abundance of a given species lead to
		  extinction of other species, this species can be
		  characterized as functionally extinct even though it still
		  exists. Although such functional extinctions have been
		  observed in some ecosystems, their frequency is largely
		  unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore
		  the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in
		  ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive
		  critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing
		  their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the
		  network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical
		  food webs, we show that the species most likely to go
		  extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is
		  increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80{\%}
		  of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting
		  that a species' ecological functionality is often lost
		  before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we
		  find that large-bodied species at the top of the food
		  chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality
		  rate and small decreases in abundance before going
		  functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower
		  in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential
		  importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks
		  and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more
		  community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with
		  target levels for populations based on ecological
		  functionality rather than on mere persistence.},

  abstract	= {To identify the factors that determine the geographical
		  range sizes of ectoparasites with different degrees of host
		  specificity. Location The study used data on the
		  distributions of fleas of the genus Amphipsylla and their
		  rodent hosts across the Holarctic. Methods All known points
		  of occurrence of 32 flea species and 51 species of their
		  rodent hosts were mapped. The shape and size of the
		  geographical range of each species were estimated using a
		  combination of the minimal convex polygon technique and
		  modelling with the garp algorithm. Factors determining the
		  geographical range sizes of the fleas were identified using
		  stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results The
		  geographical range size of fleas that are strongly
		  host-specific across their entire ranges correlated
		  positively with the geographical range size of the fleas'
		  principal hosts, and negatively with the geographical range
		  size of the fleas' potential competitors. The geographical
		  range sizes of both (1) fleas that are locally
		  host-specific but that shift their host preferences
		  geographically, and (2) host-opportunistic fleas were
		  positively correlated only with the area of the
		  geographical ranges of their principal hosts. Strongly
		  host-specific fleas occupied 0.2–80.0{\%} of the
		  geographical range of their principal hosts, whereas this
		  figure was 0.9–83.7{\%} in locally host-specific fleas
		  and 16.6–63.7{\%} in host-opportunistic fleas. Main
		  conclusions The main determinant of the geographical range
		  size of a flea species is the size of the geographical
		  range of its hosts. The role of potential competitors in
		  determining the geographical range size is stronger in
		  host-specific than in host-opportunistic fleas. Cases in
		  which the geographical range of a parasite is smaller than
		  the geographical range(s) of its host(s) owing to narrower
		  parasite environmental tolerances are much more frequent in
		  host-opportunistic than in host-specific fleas.},

  abstract	= {A climate warming of 2–5°C by the end of the century
		  will impact the likelihood of seed germination of sugar
		  maple ( Acer saccharum ), a dominant tree species which
		  possesses a restricted temperature range to ensure
		  successful reproduction. We hypothesize that seed origin
		  affects germination due to the species' local adaptation to
		  temperature. We tested this by experimentally investigating
		  the effect of incubation temperature and temperature
		  shifting on sugar maple seed germination from seven
		  different seed sources representing the current species
		  range. Survival analysis showed that seeds from the
		  northern range had the highest germination percentage,
		  while the southern range had the lowest. The mean
		  germination percentage under constant temperatures was best
		  when temperatures were ≤5°C, whereas germination
		  percentages plummeted at temperatures ≥11°C (5.8{\%}).
		  Cool shifting increased germination by 19.1{\%} over
		  constant temperature treatments and by 29.3{\%} over warm
		  shifting treatments. Both shifting treatments caused
		  earlier germination relative to the constant temperature
		  treatments. A climate warming of up to +5°C is shown to
		  severely reduce germination of seeds from the southern
		  range. However, under a more pronounced warming of 7°C,
		  seed germination at the northern range become more affected
		  and now comparable to those found from the southern range.
		  This study states that the high seed germination percentage
		  found in sugar maple at the northern range makes it fairly
		  resilient to the warmest projected temperature increase for
		  the next century. These findings provide forest managers
		  with the necessary information to make accurate projections
		  when considering strategies for future regeneration while

		  that there is a negative interaction between energy
		  availability and area in their effect on species richness.
		  The slope of the species-area relationship is lower in
		  areas with higher levels of available energy, and the slope
		  of the species-energy relationship is lower for larger
		  areas. This three-dimensional species-area-energy
		  relationship can be understood in terms of probabilistic

  abstract	= {In the face of environmental change, species can evolve
		  new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic
		  conditions or move spatially to maintain existing
		  physiological associations with particular climates that
		  define each species' climatic niche. When environmental
		  change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales,
		  vagile species are expected to move geographically by
		  tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test
		  for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the
		  Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53
		  species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on
		  four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird
		  distributions resulted in focal species shifting their
		  average climatological range over time. By comparing the
		  directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of
		  species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48
		  species (90.6{\%}) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis
		  of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence
		  data significantly predicted the temperature and
		  precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in
		  50 species (94.3{\%}), site-specific occupancy models
		  showed that the position of each site relative to the
		  climatic niche centroid explained colonization and
		  extinction probabilities better than a null model with
		  constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that
		  the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra
		  Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive
		  changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic
		  models derived from niche theory might be used successfully
		  to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face
		  of climate change.},

  abstract	= {SynthesisThe identification of distinctive patterns in
		  species x site presence-absence matrices is important for
		  understanding meta-community organisation. We compared the
		  performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have
		  been proposed to measure patterns of segregation,
		  aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover.
		  We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can
		  be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs, indicating
		  that these seemingly opposite patterns are closely related.
		  Recently proposed classification schemes failed to
		  correctly classify realistic matrices that included
		  multiple co-occurrence structures. We propose using a
		  combination of metrics and decomposing matrix-wide patterns
		  into those of individual pairs of species and sites to
		  pinpoint sources of non-randomness.Null model analysis has
		  been a popular tool for detecting pattern in binary
		  presence–absence matrices, and previous tests have
		  identified algorithms and metrics that have good
		  statistical properties. However, the behavior of different
		  metrics is often correlated, making it difficult to
		  distinguish different patterns. We compared the performance
		  of a suite of null models and metrics that have been
		  proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation,
		  nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that
		  any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered
		  to highlight aggregated pairs. As a consequence, the same
		  null model can identify a single matrix as being
		  simultaneously aggregated, segregated or nested. These
		  results cast doubt on previous conclusions of matrix-wide
		  species segregation based on the C-score and the
		  fixed-fixed algorithm. Similarly, we found that recently
		  proposed classification schemes based on patterns of
		  coherence, nestedness, and segregation and aggregation
		  cannot be uniquely distinguished using proposed metrics and
		  null model algorithms. It may be necessary to use a
		  combination of different metrics and to decompose
		  matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of

  abstract	= {Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate of metabolism of a
		  resting, postabsorptive, non-reproductive, adult bird or
		  mammal, measured during the inactive circadian phase at a
		  thermoneutral temperature. BMR is one of the most widely
		  measured physiological traits, and data are available for
		  over 1,200 species. With data available for such a wide
		  range of species, BMR is a benchmark measurement in
		  ecological and evolutionary physiology, and is often used
		  as a reference against which other levels of metabolism are
		  compared. Implicit in such comparisons is the assumption
		  that BMR is invariant for a given species and that it
		  therefore represents a stable point of comparison. However,
		  BMR shows substantial variation between individuals,
		  populations and species. Investigation of the ultimate
		  (evolutionary) explanations for these differences remains
		  an active area of inquiry, and explanation of size-related
		  trends remains a contentious area. Whereas explanations for
		  the scaling of BMR are generally mechanistic and claim ties
		  to the first principles of chemistry and physics,
		  investigations of mass-independent variation typically take
		  an evolutionary perspective and have demonstrated that BMR
		  is ultimately linked with a range of extrinsic variables
		  including diet, habitat temperature, and net primary
		  productivity. Here we review explanations for size-related
		  and mass-independent variation in the BMR of animals, and
		  suggest ways that the various explanations can be evaluated
		  and integrated.},

@Article{	  wiens2011,
  abstract	= {In this paper, I review the relevance of the niche to
		  biogeography, and what biogeography may tell us about the
		  niche. The niche is defined as the combination of abiotic
		  and biotic conditions where a species can persist. I argue
		  that most biogeographic patterns are created by niche
		  differences over space, and that even 'geographic barriers'
		  must have an ecological basis. However, we know little
		  about specific ecological factors underlying most
		  biogeographic patterns. Some evidence supports the
		  importance of abiotic factors, whereas few examples exist
		  of large-scale patterns created by biotic interactions. I
		  also show how incorporating biogeography may offer new
		  perspectives on resource-related niches and species
		  interactions. Several examples demonstrate that even after
		  a major evolutionary radiation within a region, the region
		  can still be invaded by ecologically similar species from
		  another clade, countering the long-standing idea that
		  communities and regions are generally 'saturated' with
		  species. I also describe the somewhat paradoxical situation
		  where competition seems to limit trait evolution in a
		  group, but does not prevent co-occurrence of species with
		  similar values for that trait (called here the
		  'competition-divergence-co-occurrence conundrum'). In
		  general, the interface of biogeography and ecology could be
		  a major area for research in both fields.},

@Article{	  williams2000,
  abstract	= {Several of the most ambitious theories in ecology describe
		  food webs that document the structure of strong and weak
		  trophic links that is responsible for ecological dynamics
		  among diverse assemblages of species. Early mechanism-based
		  theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and
		  several properties that are independent of species
		  richness. This theory was overturned by empirical studies
		  that found food webs to be much more complex, but these
		  studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the
		  complexity. Here we show that a remarkably simple model
		  fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key
		  structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive
		  food webs in the primary literature. These properties
		  include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and
		  basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of
		  generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the
		  degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic
		  similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species
		  number and connectance, our 'niche model' extends the
		  existing 'cascade model and improves its fit ten-fold by
		  constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of
		  prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche.},

		  report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating
		  predator density affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal)
		  cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested
		  explicit predictions from a model for our system that
		  allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence
		  of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive
		  ability and defence against consumption, and examined its
		  effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary
		  potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal
		  cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle
		  periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey
		  and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically
		  variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and
		  predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as
		  predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can
		  substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore
		  that attempts to understand population oscillations in
