- Les hommes de chez toi, dit le petit prince, cultivent cinq milles roses dans un même jardin.... et ils n'y trouvent pas ce qu'ils cherchent....
- Ils ne trouvent pas, répondis-je...
- Et cependant ce qu'ils cherchent pourrait être trouvé dans une seule rose ou un peu d'eau ...
- Bien sûr, répondis-je.
Et le petit prince ajouta :
- Mais les yeux sont aveugles. Il faut chercher avec le coeur.



la modestie sied au savant, mais pas aux idées qui l'habitent et qu'il doit défendre (Jacques Monod dans la préface du hasard et de la nécessité)

> In the first place we must remember that new species can only be formed when and where there is room for them. (Wallace :56)

> However, it is argued that applying bio-climatic models at macro-scales, where climatic influences on species distributions are shown to be dominant, can minimize the impact of biotic interactions. Indeed, the fact that a number of bioclimatic models have been highly successful at simulating current species distributions at certain scales is in fundamental disagreement with the proposition that species distributions cannot be adequately defined by climatic factors alone. [@Pearson2003]

>  We will never be able to predict the future with accuracy, but we need a strategy for using
existing knowledge and bioclimatic modeling to improve understanding of the likely effects of future climate on biodiversity. [@Araujo2006].


> (@macarthur1972geographical:154) Does the environment dictate the structure of the community, or are the species a fairly random assemblage?

> The symmetry assumption is equivalent to asking how many of the properties of ecological communities are captured by the mean, ignoring species differences. [hubbel]


> Generalist consumers should typically be weakly coupled to any one of their prey populations because, when feeding on many different species, they cannot be strongly coupled to any one of them @Murdoch2002

<!-- 'The types of questions we pose and the types of observations we make bear witness to our preconceptions. There is no way to get rid of them. There is nothing wrong with this, but we should be aware of it. When we look around us we actually see mirrors of our ideas. We can try to change ourselves on the basis of what we see, but we cannot do without the projections we impose on reality. Observations and statements span the full range from facts via interpretation to abstract ideas. The more abstract the idea, the more important the mirror effect.' Kojjman -->


Size alone is not enough to describe the process of substrate use and the implied uptake.
For several reasons, energy reserves should be considered as well, even in the most simple models Kooijman

> ‘Paraphrasing Picasso, MacArthur once observed “a theory is a lie which makes you see the truth”. If the equilibrium theory forced us to pose new questions and to seek new evidence in order to better understand [insular] com- munities, its purpose has been fulfilled.’ (after MacArthur’s first graduate student, K.L. Crowell, 1986)
