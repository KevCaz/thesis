# The source files of my phd

Markdown and Latex files (and some R code to create figures) I use to
write my PhD thesis.

Before releasing it, I have worked on it as a private repository. As I have defended
my thesis (on December the 13th), I have turned the repo public (while I am finishing to correct some typos).

If you are interested in the Makefile, I have created a separate repository including a minimal example [in this repository](https://github.com/letiR/TheseCanevas).

# To do

1. I will likely turn the document into [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) format.
