# The source files to build my PhD thesis

Markdown, Latex files and some R code to create figures I use to
write my PhD thesis.

Before releasing it, I have worked on it as a private repository. As I have
defended my thesis (on December 13th, 2016), I have turned the repository public.

Note that I have created a separate repository including a [minimal example](https://github.com/inSileco/TheseCanevas).


# To do

1. [ ] I will likely turn my thesis as a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) format.
