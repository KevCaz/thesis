# The source files of my phd

Markdown and Latex files (and some R code to create a few figures) I use to
write my PhD thesis.

Before releasing it, I have worked on it as a private repository. As I defend it
I turn the repo public.

If you are interested in the makefile I have add a minimal example [in this repository](https://github.com/letiR/TheseCanevas).

# To do

1. I will likely turn the docunment into [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) format.
